# K-means clustering algorithm

A basic implementation of a K-means clustering algorithm. Can be used to customer segmentation, etc.

Used the classic iris dataset to cluster data points into 3 groups.

The implementation is run from the

~~~~ python
if __name__ == '__main__':"
~~~~
block.

This implementation was written quickly for an assignment, so some legibility was sacrificed for speed. Having said that, it's relatively clean code for a quick implementation.

Packages required:

    pandas, for data importing and manipulation
    numpy, for calculation
